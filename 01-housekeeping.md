## Course Overview

We'll start with the fundamentals—variables, data types, and control flow—and build toward real engineering problems. By the end of this track you will have a dependable toolkit you can apply to calculations, reporting, and automation.

## Course Format

Expect a mix of walkthroughs, code-along notebooks, short exercises, and mini-projects. Formats will evolve as the course matures, so treat this repository as a living document. When I tighten something up or add a new example, you will see it here first.

## How to Approach the Essentials

- Be patient with the basics. A solid foundation makes the advanced topics straightforward.
- Set aside 2-6 hours per week and guard the time. Consistency beats intensity.
- Type the examples out. Break them, fix them, and tweak them. Muscle memory matters.
- Build small personal projects. Automate a report, study a dataset, or tidy a workflow at work.
- Swap notes with other engineers. Share questions and lessons learned—the collaboration pays off.
- Read the docs. Python's documentation (and most libraries you will touch) is excellent. Make it a habit.

## Tools You Will Use Most

- Python 3 (managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE)
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration
- Git and GitHub for version control

If you want a quickest-path setup, the [Lean Startup walkthrough](python-for-engineers-lean-startup.md) gets you coding in a notebook with the essentials installed.
